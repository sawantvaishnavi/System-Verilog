Q1. What will this print?

int arr[5];
initial begin
  $display("%0d", arr.size());
  arr = '{1,2,3};
  $display("%0d", arr.size());
end

Ans: this is an error. First it prints 5, then gives a compile-time error because static array size (5) cannot be assigned with 3 elements.
SystemVerilog requires exact size match for static array assignment.

Q1.b what if arr is dynamic arry?
int arr[];   // dynamic array
initial begin
  arr = '{1,2,3};
  $display("Size = %0d", arr.size());
end

Ans: it will copy and give size as 3.

Q2.what will print?
int a[] = '{1,2,3};
int b[];
initial begin
  b = a;
  b[0] = 100;
  $display("%p", a);
end

Ans: [1, 2, 3]
In SystemVerilog, dynamic arrays use deep copy assignment.
That means:
Memory of a is copied into b
b gets its own separate memory
They do NOT share the same storage

after b=a  a → [1 2 3]  b → [1 2 3]  Two separate memory blocks.
now b[0] = 100 so b → [100 2 3] and a remains same.

Q3.  What will this print?
int arr[];
initial begin
  $display(arr.size());
end

Ans: 0
arr is a dynamic array It is declared but not allocated
Unallocated dynamic array has size = 0

Q4. Which is faster in simulation? 1.Static array 2.Dynamic array 3.Associative array 4.Queue
Ans. 
1.Static Array (Fastest)
Fixed size
Contiguous memory
No resizing
No runtime allocation
Index access is direct
Simulator knows size at compile time → very efficient.

2.Dynamic Array
Size decided at runtime
Memory allocated on heap
Still contiguous memory
Slight overhead for allocation and resizing
Access is still fast (like static), but allocation adds overhead.

3.Queue
Dynamic structure
Supports push_front, pop_front, insert, delete
Elements may shift during operations
Extra management logic → slower than dynamic array.

4.Associative Array (Slowest)
Implemented like hash table
Keys can be int, string, etc.
Memory not contiguous
Needs hashing and lookup logic
Flexible, but more computational work → slowest.

Summary:
Static array is fastest because it has fixed size and contiguous memory.
Dynamic array is slightly slower due to runtime allocation.
Queue is slower because of resizing and shifting operations.
Associative array is slowest due to hashing and non-contiguous memory.


Q5. Where are dynamic arrays stored?
Ans:
Dynamic arrays are stored in the simulator’s heap memory. Not stack.

Explanation:
Static arrays → allocated at compile time (fixed memory region)
Dynamic arrays → allocated at runtime using heap

When you write:
arr = new[10];
The simulator allocates memory from heap.

Important:
SystemVerilog simulation memory is managed by the simulator, not like real hardware RAM. But conceptually:

Static array → fixed memory
Dynamic array → heap memory
Class objects → heap memory
Queue → heap memory
Associative array → heap memory
