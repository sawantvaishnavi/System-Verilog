Q1. What will this print?

int arr[5];
initial begin
  $display("%0d", arr.size());
  arr = '{1,2,3};
  $display("%0d", arr.size());
end

Ans: this is an error. First it prints 5, then gives a compile-time error because static array size (5) cannot be assigned with 3 elements.
SystemVerilog requires exact size match for static array assignment.

Q1.b what if arr is dynamic arry?
int arr[];   // dynamic array
initial begin
  arr = '{1,2,3};
  $display("Size = %0d", arr.size());
end

Ans: it will copy and give size as 3.

Q2.what will print?
int a[] = '{1,2,3};
int b[];
initial begin
  b = a;
  b[0] = 100;
  $display("%p", a);
end

Ans: [1, 2, 3]
In SystemVerilog, dynamic arrays use deep copy assignment.
That means:
Memory of a is copied into b
b gets its own separate memory
They do NOT share the same storage

after b=a  a → [1 2 3]  b → [1 2 3]  Two separate memory blocks.
now b[0] = 100 so b → [100 2 3] and a remains same.

Q3.  What will this print?
int arr[];
initial begin
  $display(arr.size());
end

Ans: 0
arr is a dynamic array It is declared but not allocated
Unallocated dynamic array has size = 0
