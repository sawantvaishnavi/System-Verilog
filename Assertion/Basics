Type of assertion:
  1.Simple immediate assertion:               assert
  2.Observed deffered immediate assertion:    assert #0
  3.Final deffered immediate assertion:       assert final
  4.Concurrent assertion:                     assert property

/*

  Rules of Assertion:

  Rule 1:

  1. Simple Immediate Assertion (sia)  -->  Require Procedural block
    It could be either
      1: initial
          begin
          end
      2:  always@(*)  / always@(posedge clk)  /  always_comb  /  always_ff
            begin
            end

  2. odia + fdia  -->  do not require procedural block for combinational ckt
                        require procedural block for sequential

  Rule 2: Pass/Fail Action

    1. sia --> supports multiple pass / fail action
    2. odia + fdia  --> supports single pass / fail

/*
Expression:

1. sia :       assert ( expression of expected behaviour)  $info ("pass action") ; else $error ("fail action");
2.odia :       assert #0 ( )  $info ("pass action") ; else $error ("fail action");
3.fdia :       assert final ( )  $info ("pass action") ; else $error ("fail action");


*/
/*
Disabling Assertion: 1.Specific assertion check  2.All assertion check

1. $assertoff();
   $asserton();

2. sia:  if-else, case
   dia:  disable A1;
